Source is a 3D game engine developed by Valve.
It debuted as the successor to GoldSrc with Half-Life: Source in June 2004,
followed by Counter-Strike: Source and Half-Life 2 later that year.
Source does not have a concise version numbering scheme; instead, it was released in incremental versions

Source code is based on TF2 2018 leak. Don't use it for commercial purposes.
